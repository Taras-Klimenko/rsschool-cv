**Hello there!**

My name is Taras Klimenko and I am a full-stack developer with over 1.5 years of experience. During this time, I have learned and applied a wide range of web development tools: from responsive design to managing global application state, from creating databases to writing REST APIs, from setting up linters and bundlers to collaborative development using Git. I really enjoy seeing all the components of an application work together seamlessly, like gears in a complex clockwork mechanism.
